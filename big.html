							<h1 class="major">The IoT associated with a data collection process</h1>
							<p>Today, technology is within everyone's reach, allowing them a 24-hour connection from phones, computers, and smart homes is called the Internet of Things (IoT)(martinekuan, 2020); the main objective of IoT is to make the process easier in different fields and to improve life quality; these connections are increasing daily, and the chances of data collected from them also increase. The IoT worldwide during 2023 is forecast to grow 10.6% to $805.7 billion, expected investments in IoT technologies are also high with expectations surpassing $1 trillion in 2026 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% over the 2023-2027 forecast period (Weissberger, 2023)</p>
							<p>Although IoT devices make our lives easy, they collect large-scale data and have fragile security mechanisms that pose a severe challenge regarding the safety and privacy of their users. The most common risk of using IoT is a Cyber-attack; it is an intentional effort to steal, expose, alter, disable, or destroy data(IBM, 2020). Cyber-attacks have different motivations; criminal-motivated attackers steal financial data, and political-motivated are associated with cyberwarfare, cyberterrorism, or "hacktivism.".</p>
							<p>On the other hand, one of the challenges associated with collecting data on such a large scale is web scraping. Web scraping allows IoT devices to collect data from various online sources such as websites, social media platforms, news portals, and online databases (IoT.Business.News, 2023). Web scraping is legal when it involves a public website but does not include personal data (Dimelgani, 2023). Although the extraction of personal data is illegal, data protection laws lack these criteria because the GDPR has strict regulations on personal data, but if the personal data is not of EU citizens or residents, the GDPR may not be applied (Daruwalla, 2023; Musella, 2020). It is important to know that personal data can be stolen from websites since there are APIs that can collect all personal data. For this reason, data scientists need to be ethical and aware of the legal implications.</p>
