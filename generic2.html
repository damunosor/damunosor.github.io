						<p> Normalization is a technique for producing a set of relations with desirable properties, given the data requirements of an enterprise. Normalization is a formal method that can be used to identify relations based on their keys and the functional dependencies among their attributes.(Connolly, T. M. & Begg, C. E,2015) </p>

						<h2>Google Earth Engine (GEE)  API</h2>
						<p>Google exposes most of its services via API (Siriwardena, 2020). The GEE API was introduced in 2022 as a free service if users use it for academic, government, and research, but the users who use it for commercial have a fee for use  (GEE, 2022a, 2022b)To use the GEE API, first must have an account for using credentials to make authenticated requests. But when the user authenticates in the Earth Engine flow, their personal data is vulnerable because they allow access to their account. Also, the code that is included in the notebook will be copied or changed. </p>
						<p>Also, the GEE API should improve the authentication flow because vulnerabilities that exist in a traditional HTTP request-response interaction cannot detect what an attacker uses to exploit it. Some of the attacks mentioned in (Montenegro, 2020) include blind server-side XML/SOAP injection, blind XSS (delayed XSS), host header attack, out-of-band remote code execution (OOB RCE), out-of-band SQL injection (OOB SQLi), email header injection, server-side request forgery (SSRF), XML external entity injection (XXE), OS code injection: OOB  and XXE: Out of Band </p>
						<p>The opportunity to USE the GEE API is to get access to a multi-petabyte platform of satellite imagery and a geospatial database. The users can visualize and analyze satellite images to understand and solve the environmental problems of our planet. For example, identify habitats, land cover changes, deforestation, fire monitoring, etc.</p>
						<p>Please click on learn more. A GEE API map will be found.</p>

						<h2>Development team project</h2>
						<p>Team:Joy Ngugi,Alex Mutebe and Daniela Mu&ntildeoz</p>
						<h2>Summary</h2>
						<p>This project delves into the design and implementation of a relational database, which serves as a foundation for data-informed decisions and analysis related to investment in Manhattan’s real estate market. The intricacies of the relational database model and how it aligns with the specific needs of investors are also explored. The implementation process is discussed detailing how data was collected, cleaned, and integrated into the database. Finally, the report addresses the legal and data privacy policies related to the data management pipeline processes, ensuring data privacy and legal considerations are observed.</p>
