						<h2>Case Studie:Ebola</h2>
						<p> Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus(CDC, 2023). During the years 2014 to 2016, the African continent was the most affected and had the worst outbreak. Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone were the countries most affected. The World Health Organization made public all data regarding confirmed and probable cases, critical weeks, and data sources. The dataset represents the best estimates of WHO using methodologies for specific indicators (WHO, 2016).Therefore, it is an extensive database of 32067 records.  For this reason, it is important to do the data cleaning, detecting and correcting inaccurate records. It will help to analyze the data for each of the countries, compare them, and be able to make important graphs that allow us to understand the problematic.</p>

						<p> Normalization is a technique for producing a set of relations with desirable properties, given the data requirements of an enterprise. Normalization is a formal method that can be used to identify relations based on their keys and the functional dependencies among their attributes.(Connolly, T. M. & Begg, C. E,2015) </p>

						<h2>Google Earth Engine (GEE)  API</h2>
						<p>Google exposes most of its services via API (Siriwardena, 2020). The GEE API was introduced in 2022 as a free service if users use it for academic, government, and research, but the users who use it for commercial have a fee for use  (GEE, 2022a, 2022b)To use the GEE API, first must have an account for using credentials to make authenticated requests. But when the user authenticates in the Earth Engine flow, their personal data is vulnerable because they allow access to their account. Also, the code that is included in the notebook will be copied or changed. </p>
						<p>Also, the GEE API should improve the authentication flow because vulnerabilities that exist in a traditional HTTP request-response interaction cannot detect what an attacker uses to exploit it. Some of the attacks mentioned in (Montenegro, 2020) include blind server-side XML/SOAP injection, blind XSS (delayed XSS), host header attack, out-of-band remote code execution (OOB RCE), out-of-band SQL injection (OOB SQLi), email header injection, server-side request forgery (SSRF), XML external entity injection (XXE), OS code injection: OOB  and XXE: Out of Band </p>
						<p>The opportunity to USE the GEE API is to get access to a multi-petabyte platform of satellite imagery and a geospatial database. The users can visualize and analyze satellite images to understand and solve the environmental problems of our planet. For example, identify habitats, land cover changes, deforestation, fire monitoring, etc.</p>
