							<h2>The future of the data scientist</h2>
							<p> The necessity of handling increasingly large volumes of data, and understanding its complexities, is causing professionals with backgrounds in data science to turn to this discipline. For example, earth science and remote sensing specialists are taking steps to improve their knowledge in statistics, math, and programming. The idea is that by learning data science they can better perform their tasks. That is, they take advantage of the range of techniques to support sophisticated reasoning across space and time, like clustering, propagation, and extrapolation methods. Also, by using data science they can optimize the integration of data and models that operate at different spatial and temporal scales (Anon, 2010), which are very common in environmental sciences. </p>
							<p> For example, large volumes of data are collected via remote sensing where environmental phenomena are observed without contact with the phenomena, typically from satellite sensing or aircraft-borne sensing devices, including the use of drones. This includes passive sensing, such as photography or infrared imagery, and active sensing, e.g., RADAR/LIDAR. The increasing availability of open satellite data, in particular, is a major trend in earth and environmental sciences, such as, the EU Copernicus program and the associated Sentinel missions, or NASA's Landsat archive are regularly mined for data for various applications(Langley et al., 2016). So data science has a profound impact on wide range of activities (Dhar, 2013).</p>
							<p> In the future, environmental data scientists will have many opportunities to work because all companies are interested in automatizing their processes and solving environmental problems like climate change using data from different sources. (Saxena, 2021) stated this by saying that “It is true that companies will keep focusing on the automated workflow of machine learning. But, remember, no company wants to depend on another company for their work” for that in the future all businesses will have a big team of data scientist while data scientist will need training all time due to that all time has new techniques to processes and analyze the data. Alternatively, (Yıldırım, 2021) refers that becoming a data scientist is not necessary to obtain all these skills. However, if the data scientist improves all these skills, it will increase the opportunities to work like an environmental data scientist. </p>
